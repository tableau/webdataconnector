title: "Web Data Connectors to use QT WebEngine in Tableau 2019.4"
abstract: "In Tableau 2019.4 and later, Web Data Connectors switched to new internal browser. Because of this change some existing WDCs might experience issues when used in Tableau 2019.4 and later."
---


Prior to Tableau 2019.4, Web Data Connectors used an internal browser in Tableau called Qt WebKit. In Tableau 2019.4 and later, Web Data Connectors use Qt WebEngine (a Chromium-based browser). Because of the change from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine in Tableau, customers and developers of some WDCs might encounter issues. For more information, see [Troubleshoot WDC WebEngine Issues in Tableau 2019.4 and later]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/wdc_webengine.html).
