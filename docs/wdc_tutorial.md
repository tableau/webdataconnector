By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working WDC that connects to the [USGS Earthquake
feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/index.php) and downloads data for earthquakes that occurred in
the last week.

You'll learn how to:

* TOC
{:toc}

If you *really* want to skip all of this and go straight to the source code, look for the `earthquakeUSGS` files in the
`Examples` directory. You'll get a lot more out of this if you build it from scratch though--promise!

**Note**: The connector that we'll create in this tutorial (`earthquakeWDC`) has a different name than the same
connector in the `Examples` directory (`earthquakeUSGS`). This is to minimize the chances of accidentally overwriting
the existing sample. However, if you copy the existing sample, you'll have to change file paths.

**Note**: The browser used inside Tableau is QT WebKit, which does not natively support new ES6 features.  If you wish to take advantage of newer features (such as promises) when building WDCs you will need to use a polyfill.

### Create the HTML page

When you open a WDC in Tableau, you display an HTML page that links to your JavaScript code and to the WDC library.
Optionally, this page can also display a user interface for your users to select the data that they want to download.

Create a new file named `earthquakeWDC.html` and save it in the top-level directory of the `webdataconnector`
repository. (This is the same directory as the README.)

Then, copy the following code into the file:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>USGS Earthquake Feed</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-store" />

    <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    <script src="https://connectors.tableau.com/libs/tableauwdc-2.3.latest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="earthquakeWDC.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <div class="container container-table">
        <div class="row vertical-center-row">
            <div class="text-center col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
                <button type="button" id="submitButton" class="btn btn-success" style="margin: 10px;">Get Earthquake Data!</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

Let's run through what the code is doing. Skipping over the standard markup for an HTML page, you'll notice the
following between the `head` tags:

* The `meta` tag prevents your browser from caching the page.
* The `bootstrap.min.css` and `bootstrap.min.js` files are used to simplify styling and formatting.
* The `jquery.min.js` file will be used as a helper library by our connector. (For example, the connector uses jQuery to
  get JSON data.)
* The `tableauwdc-2.3.latest.js` file is the main library for the WDC API.
* The `earthquakeWDC.js` file is the (not yet created) JavaScript code for our connector.

Between the `body` tags, there is a simple button element that illustrates how users can interact with your connector
before getting data. In a later step, you'll attach an event listener to the button in the JavaScript code.

### Create the connector object

Now that you've created a user interface, it's time to write the JavaScript code for the connector. Create a new file
named `earthquakeWDC.js` and save it in the same directory as the `earthquakeWDC.html` file.

Copy the following code into the file to create the basic structure of the connector:

```js
(function () {
    var myConnector = tableau.makeConnector();

    myConnector.getSchema = function (schemaCallback) {

    };

    myConnector.getData = function (table, doneCallback) {

    };

    tableau.registerConnector(myConnector);
})();
```

Some things to note about the code:

* The code is wrapped in an immediately invoked function expression to create a local scope.
* The `tableau` object isn't defined in our code, but in the WDC library. (It's assigned to the global scope.)
* The `makeConnector` function is a constructor that predefines some methods for our connector object.
* The `getSchema` and `getData` functions are placeholders for now, but will contain the logic for getting the table
  schema of the data and downloading the data.
* The `registerConnector` function validates the connector object before initialization.

### Add an event listener

Remember how we added a button to the HTML page? It's time to create an event listener that responds to clicking on the
button.

Copy the following code and paste it directly below the `registerConnector` function:

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
    $("#submitButton").click(function () {
        tableau.connectionName = "USGS Earthquake Feed";
        tableau.submit();
    });
});
```

Here's what is going on in the code snippet:

* The jQuery `$(document).ready` function runs some code when the page loads.
* An click event listener is added to the button element created earlier. The button is identified by the `submitButton`
  id.
* The `tableau.connectionName` variable defines what we want to call the connector data source when it is displayed in
  Tableau.
* The `tableau.submit()` function sends the connector object to Tableau for validation.

**Tip**: Not every connector needs a user interface. If you want a connector to run without user input, you can use
custom initialization code. For more information, see [Custom Initialization and Shutdown]({{ site.baseurl
}}/docs/wdc_custom_init_and_shutdown)

### Test the connector so far

The connector doesn't *do* very much so far, but it's enough that we can run it in the simulator.

**Note**: Have you followed the steps in the [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs) topic to set up the simulator? This
section assumes that you've installed dependencies already.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal in the top-level directory for the `webdataconnector` repository.

1. Run `npm start` to run the test server.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:8888/Simulator/index.html
   ```
1. In the WDC URL field, enter the path to your WDC relative to the simulator. For example, if you created your WDC in
   the top-level directory, you might enter:

   ```
   ../earthquakeWDC.html
   ```
1. Click the **Start Interactive Phase** button.
   The connector page appears in a new window.

1. Click **Get Earthquake Data!**.
   The connector page closes.

At this point, you might be thinking "Well...did it work?" Let's add a log message so that you can practice debugging
the connector.

#### Add a log message to confirm it is working (sort of)

1. In the `earthquakeWDC.js` file, copy the following code and replace the empty `myConnector.getSchema` function:

   ```js
   myConnector.getSchema = function (schemaCallback) {
       tableau.log("Hello WDC!");
   };
   ```
   The `tableau.log` function allows you to pass messages from your connector back to the simulator. These log messages
   are then printed with the browser's built-in `console.log()` function on the simulator page.

1. Refresh the simulator page in your browser.
1. Open your browser's developer tools. For example, in Chrome you can press **Ctrl+Shift+I**.
1. Click **Start Interactive Phase**.
1. Click **Get Earthquake Data!**.

If all goes well, you should see `Hello WDC!` in your browser's console.

### Define a schema

So the connector is working now--sort of. Before you can download data and pass it to Tableau, you need to define how
you want to map the data to one or more or tables. This mapping of data is done in the schema.

To decide what data you want to map in the schema, you can take a look at the USGS description of the JSON data source:
[GeoJSON Summary Format](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php){:target="_blank"}. Rather than map all the data available from the
data source, this example has selected a focused subset.

When you're done looking at the summary of the JSON data source, copy the following code into the `earthquakeWDC.js`
file and replace the placeholder `getSchema` function:

```js
myConnector.getSchema = function (schemaCallback) {
    var cols = [{
        id: "id",
        dataType: tableau.dataTypeEnum.string
    }, {
        id: "mag",
        alias: "magnitude",
        dataType: tableau.dataTypeEnum.float
    }, {
        id: "title",
        alias: "title",
        dataType: tableau.dataTypeEnum.string
    }, {
        id: "location",
        dataType: tableau.dataTypeEnum.geometry
    }];

    var tableSchema = {
        id: "earthquakeFeed",
        alias: "Earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5 in the last seven days",
        columns: cols
    };

    schemaCallback([tableSchema]);
};
```

Here's what's going on in the code:

* The `getSchema` function takes a `schemaCallback` parameter which is defined by the WDC API.
* The `cols` variable contains an array of JavaScript objects, where each object defines a single column in our table.
  In this example, there are columns for magnitude, title, and location. Note that for each column you can
  specify additional options. For example, the alias defines a friendly name that can appear in Tableau and the
  columnRole determines whether a field is a measure or a dimension. The `id` can only contain alphanumeric values (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscore characters (`_`). The identifiers cannot contain spaces, hyphens, or special characters. For more options, see [the API reference]({{
      site.baseurl }}/docs/api_ref.html#webdataconnectorapi.columninfo){:target="_blank"}.
* The `tableSchema` variable defines the schema for a single table and contains a JavaScript object. Here, the value of
  the `columns` property is set to the `cols` array defined earlier.
* The `schemaCallback` gets called when the schema is defined. The `schemaCallback` takes an array of table objects. In
  this case, there is only table object (the `tableSchema` object defined above).

**Note**: The [API Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/api_ref) describes the properties that you can define for the table
object and for each object in the table columns in more detail. For now, let's plunge ahead to the exciting
part--getting the data!

### Get the data

Once the schema is defined, you can begin getting data and passing it to Tableau.

Copy the following code and replace the placeholder `getData` function:

```js
myConnector.getData = function(table, doneCallback) {
    $.getJSON("https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson", function(resp) {
        var feat = resp.features,
            tableData = [];

        // Iterate over the JSON object
        for (var i = 0, len = feat.length; i < len; i++) {
            tableData.push({
                "id": feat[i].id,
                "mag": feat[i].properties.mag,
                "title": feat[i].properties.title,
                "location": feat[i].geometry
            });
        }

        table.appendRows(tableData);
        doneCallback();
    });
};
```

Whew! That's a good-sized chunk of code. Let's see what's happening:

* The `getData` function takes two parameters: `table` and `doneCallback`. The `table` parameter is an object defined by
  the WDC to which you can append data. The `doneCallback` signals to Tableau that you are done getting data.
* The jQuery `$.getJSON` function gets earthquake data from the USGS earthquake feed and uses a success handler to store the returned data in a response parameter (`resp`). (You can open the URL in a browser to see what the JSON data looks like.)
* The `for` loop iterates over the features in the JSON object and stores the data that we want in the `tableData` array.
* The `table.appendRows` function appends the `tableData` array to the `table` as a JavaScript object.


### See it in action

By now, you're a pro at [running the simulator](http://tableau.github.io/webdataconnector/docs/#run-sim), so fire it up,
load your connector, and click **Get Earthquake Data!** like before. Now that we have a `getSchema` function properly
defined, you should see the schema displayed in the simulator.

The moment you've been waiting for is here! Click **Fetch Table Data** to run your `getData` function and display the results in a table.

!["The earthquake data is displayed in a table on the simulator page."]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wdc_sim_earthquake_geodata.png)

> **Note** The location information for an earthquake is returned as a JSON object, which is why you might see `object Object` displayed in the simulator. Tableau 10.4 added support for geoJSON data, so while the simulator only knows you have some kind of JSON object, Tableau will have no trouble parsing the coordinates from the geometry data.

To really see things working, [open your connector in Tableau](http://tableau.github.io/webdataconnector/docs/wdc_use_in_tableau):

!["The earthquake data is displayed on a map in Tableau."]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wdc_tableau_earthquake_geo_json.png)

You did it! Nice work. But this is no time to rest on your laurels--[try your connector in Tableau]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_use_in_tableau),
dig into the `Examples` directory to see more connectors, or read through the WDC documentation. You might want to start by
learning about [connectors with multiple tables]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_multi_table_tutorial),
[incremental refresh]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_incremental_refresh), and [authentication]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_authentication). See the [WDC Multiple Table Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_multi_table_tutorial) and [WDC Node.js Proxy with OAuth Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/wdc_oauth_tutorial.html).

Better yet, dive right in and create your own connector!
