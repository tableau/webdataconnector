title: Debugging in the Simulator and Tableau
layout: docs
---

You can use the simulator included with the WDC SDK to develop and debug your connectors more quickly. The simulator
is a JavaScript application that loads connectors in a similar way to Tableau Desktop. Additionally, Tableau
Desktop includes a built-in (although not supported) debugger that you can use to debug issues that appear in Tableau Desktop
but not in the simulator.

Use the simulator when you are developing your connector, to set breakpoints in the browser, view network requests, and
more. Use Tableau Desktop periodically during development to confirm that your connector works the same as in the
simulator, and then to perform your final testing.

This page includes information about developing and debugging your connectors both in the simulator and in Tableau.

## Debugging in the simulator {#debugging-simulator}

To set up and run the simulator, follow the instructions in the [Get Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs) section.

When you run a connector in the simulator, only the `getSchema` and `getData` parts of your connector code
run in the simulator window.  The interactive phase and authentication phases run in a separate window. This means that
messages that you print with `console.log` will appear in different browser consoles.

To print messages from both windows to the console for the main simulator window, use `tableau.log`. For example, you
might enter the following in your code:

```js
tableau.log("My console message goes here!");
```

### Simulator tips {#simulator-tips}

* By default, the test web server runs on port 8888. To change the port number, edit the `http-server` script in the
  `package.json` file.  For example, you might enter the following to change the port to 8000:

  ```
  "http-server": "node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -p 8000"
  ```

* To make it easier to load files into the simulator, keep the simulator and web data connector `.html` files that you are
  testing in the same folder.

<b>Note: </b>Tableau Desktop embeds the Qt Webkit browser into the product to display your connector pages. This browser might lack some of the features of modern browsers, including specific HTML5 and other features. For more information on browser support, <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/whatsnew57.html" target="_blank"> see the features in Qt 5.7</a>, which is the version used by Tableau (10.3 to 2018.3). You might also want to see the Qt Webkit documentation on HTML5 support and the <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Webkit_HTML5_Score" target="_blank">Qt Webkit HTML5 Score</a>.

### Caching in the simulator {#simulator-caching}

If changes to your connector do not appear to take effect in the simulator, the browser might be caching a previous version of your
connector. Here are some ways to work around caching issues:

* In some browsers, you can press **Ctrl+Shift+R** or **Cmd+Shift+R** to clear the cache for the current page and reload
  it.

* Open the simulator in an incognito window which does not store cookies or cache pages. Note that the list of recent
  connectors will not be stored if cookies are disabled.

* In Google Chrome, you can disable caching while the developer tools are open.

  1. Open Chrome Developer Tools.

  1. Press **F1** to view the settings.

  1. On the **Preferences** tab, under **Network**, select the **Disable caching** option.

### General browser debugging tips {#browser-tips}

*   Open the developer tools console for the browser.

    For example, in Google Chrome press Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows or Command+Option+I on the Mac to open the tools pane,
    and then select the <span class="uicontrol">Console</span> tab. In this console, you can see all the results of
    various console.log statements.  The console also displays output from the [tableau.log]({{ site.baseurl
    }}/docs/api_ref#webdataconnectorapi.tableau.log) and [tableau.abortWithError]({{ site.baseurl
    }}/docs/api_ref#webdataconnectorapi.tableau.abortwitherror) functions.

    This is a good place to check for errors in case anything goes wrong.  The console will display information about
    run-time errors (unhandled exceptions) that occur while your code is running. If an error occurs, the JavaScript
    engine in the browser throws an error and the error message is displayed in the console.

*   Use a debugger to step through your code.

    Most browsers include a debugger as part of their developer tools.  You can set breakpoints in your code in the
    debugger or include JavaScript `debugger` statements. When the web data connector runs and the browser's developer
    tools are open, code execution stops at breakpoints or `debugger` statements and you can examine variables.  For an
    overview of debugging tools, see [JavaScript Debugging](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_debugging.asp) on the
    W3CSchools.com site.

## Debugging in Tableau Desktop {#debugging-tableau}

Tableau Desktop includes a built-in debugger that you can use to test your connectors. Use the built-in debugger when
you encounter differences that you cannot debug in the simulator.

**Important**:

* The built-in debugger only runs on Windows.
* It is provided as-is and without official support by Tableau.
* The debugger communicates with Tableau Desktop  synchronously and therefore might appear unresponsive at times.

To run the built-in debugger, complete the following steps:

1. Open a command prompt.

1. Navigate to the Tableau Desktop directory.

   ```
   cd "C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau <version>\bin\"
   ```

1. Run Tableau Desktop with the debugging flag:

   ```
   tableau.exe -DDebugWDC
   ```

1. Connect to a web data connector.

1. Interact with your connector and start the data gathering phase.

   The built-in debugger loads.

1. The first time that you use the debugger, click the **Sources** tab, select **Always enable**, and click **Enable
   Debugging**.

   ![Enable debugging on the Sources tab.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/debugger_enable.png)

1. Click the **Show sources** button to display a list of the files used in your connector.

   ![View source files.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/debugger_show_sources.png)

1. Select a file to open it.

1. To set a breakpoint, click on a line number.

1. Press F8 to continue running your connector.
