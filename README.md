# Tableau WDC for Centrifuge

This fork of the Tableau WDC is set up to allow analysts to download data from Centrifuge api endpoints to use in Tableau.

To run this on the simulator locally, download, install, and run with `npm start`. Visit `http://localhost:8888/Simulator/index.html
`. The connector URL is `../centrifugeWDC.html`.

You will need to sign in with the email you use for Centrifuge and your user token. See a member of the dev team if you do not have this token.

We are using a quick custom form to auth each request with Centrifuge due to an issue with WDC https://github.com/tableau/webdataconnector/issues/160

To use your local Centrifuge, uncomment the line with the url in `centrifugeWDC.js`.
